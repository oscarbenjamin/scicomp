# EMAT30008 - Scientific Computing

This is the web-page for the first part of the notes for EMAT30008 -
Scientific Computing. You can find here the outline of the unit and also the
notes for a Python refresher and some of the more generic tasks involved in
scientific programming.

## Unit outline

The essential idea for this unit is to cover some selected topics in
scientific programming using Python. It is expected that all students on this
unit have prior experience of Python although we will begin with a refresher
on the language. The unit will cover some numerical methods but the idea is
to emphasise the practical rather than mathematical considerations of
scientific programming.

The unit is divided into three parts (each having an associated coursework):

1. Python refresher and intro to selected topics
2. Numerical methods for ODEs
3. Numerical methods for PDEs

This webpage provides the notes for part 1 only.
