# Basics of Python

This unit is aimed at students who have seen Python before but are perhaps a
bit rusty with it. If you've never seen Python before or can't remember it
very well then I recommend to you to follow a more detailed tutorial such as
[the one at python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). Here
we will quickly run through some of the basic features of Python to remind
everyone what it is about. The python.org tutorial has more detail on any of
the topics we cover here.

## Numbers

Python 
Python has three basic numeric types: `int`, `float`, and `complex`. As you can
probably guess the `int` type is for integers.
