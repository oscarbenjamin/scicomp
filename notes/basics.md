This unit is aimed at students who have seen Python before but are perhaps a
bit rusty with it. If you've never seen Python before then I recommend to you
to follow a more detailed tutorial such as [the one at
python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). Here we will
quickly run through some of the basic features of Python to remind everyone
what it is about. The python.org tutorial has more detail on the basics of
Python if you're unfamiliar with any of the topics discussed here.
